ANSWER NO: 05

?? AND ?:
These two operators are used to evaluate some conditional expressions which we can also do by if,else statements.

i)Condition ? Exp1:Exp2:
If condition is true, then the expression evaluates Expr1 (and returns its value); otherwise, it evaluates and returns the value of Expr2.
 
ii)Condition Exp1??Exp2:
If Expr1 is null,it evaluates and returns the value of Expr2

EXAMPLES:
void main() {
//Condition 1(?):
  var a = 15;
  var result1 =
      a > 20 ? "value greater than 20" : "value lesser than or equal to 20";
  print(result1);
//Condition 2(??)
  var b = null;
  var c = 13;
  var result2 = b ?? c;
  print(result2);
}
